# sig4j
sig4j is a Java library for Qt like 
[signals and slots](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html) which uses the
[FunctionalInterface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html)
Annotation introduced in Java 8. This Annotation allows sig4j to directly connect
functions and lambdas to signals.
